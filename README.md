# Web API ASP.NET MVC

Hello world,

This is a really simple crowdfunding API in C# ASP.NET MVC. This was done mainly for learning the repository pattern and the creation of a  DAL (data access layer) performing simple CRUD (Create,Read,Update,Delete) operations on a MySql DB. It's also a good example on how hash & salt a user password before storing it somewhere.

The API also provide a login endpoint wich generate and return a JWT token for the user.


The DAL was made using Dapper, the tokens are generated by JSON Web Tokens.

This was done "code-first" so you obviously need to create your own database and use your own connection string.

A full SQL script is available to create all the needed tables in the main repository.



Fun fact :
